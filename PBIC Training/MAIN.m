% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Two link robot arm with control to track a point that the user clicks.
% 
% Files:
% MAIN - Execute this file; parameters here.
% 
% Plotter -- Handles all integration and graphics (since the two are linked
% in the live-integration version)
% 
% FullDyn -- Dynamics function of the form zdot = dynamics(z,t,params).
% This function evaluates BOTH the controller and the dynamics. Can
% probably be crunched through ode45 if you don't care about user
% interaction.
%   
% deriverRelativeAngles -- does symbolic algebra to derive the dynamics and
% the control equations. Automatically writes these to MATLAB functions:
%   - ForwardKin, GravityCompT1, GravityCompT2, ImpedanceControl,
%   Thdotdot1, Thdotdot2 --- All these are autogenerated and should not be
%   directly altered.
